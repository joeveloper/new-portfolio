        After graduating with a degree in{" "}<span className="font-medium">Electrical Electronics Engineering</span>, I embarked on a journey to pursue my passion for programming. 
        At the outset, I immersed myself in various coding bootcamps, where I delved into the realm of{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">What truly captivates me about programming is its inherent creativity and problem-solving essence.</span>
        There's an unparalleled satisfaction in crafting exceptional products from mere lines of code and unraveling complex issues to find effective solutions.  
        I'm continuously driven to explore new <span className="italic">technologies and methodologies</span>, always seeking opportunities to broaden my skill set.
        My primary tech stack revolves around{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
        React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        , with a strong familiarity with TypeScript. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies and I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.

      <p>
        <span className="italic">Beyond coding</span>, I find joy in various hobbies. 
Whether it's indulging in video games, immersing myself in cinematic experiences{" "}

        <span className="font-medium">and reading history</span>.
